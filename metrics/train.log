[2021-08-26 10:25:25,158][tensorflow][WARNING] - FOR KERAS USERS: The object that you are saving contains one or more Keras models or layers. If you are loading the SavedModel with `tf.keras.models.load_model`, continue reading (otherwise, you may ignore the following instructions). Please change your code to save with `tf.keras.models.save_model` or `model.save`, and confirm that the file "keras.metadata" exists in the export directory. In the future, Keras will only load the SavedModels that have this file. In other words, `tf.saved_model.save` will no longer write SavedModels that can be recovered as Keras models (this will apply in TF 2.5).

FOR DEVS: If you are overwriting _tracking_metadata in your class, this property has been used to save metadata in the SavedModel. The metadta field will be deprecated soon, so please move the metadata to a different file.
